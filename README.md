Storing Tables
The butons “Store 1” and “Store 2” can be used to save the last table generated for use in the “Sort” and “Graph”
func�ons. The “Reset Store X” butons each clear their respec�ve stores.

Summarizing Produc�on and Transac�on Data
This func�on can be used for one or more sheets. For best results, let each input sheet be a separate month to show
data over �me. To use this func�on, select one or more sheets and then click “Summarize”.

## Sor�ng
The Sort func�on works for showing which sellers appear in a selec�on of exactly 3 �me periods. To use this func�on:
1. Select your first sheet and click the appropriate buton (8020 Rule Produc�on, 8020 Rule Transac�ons, Botom
20 Produc�on).
2. Once the resul�ng table shows, click the “Store 1” buton to save the table to Store 1. Next, repeat this process
by selec�ng your next sheet and the appropriate func�on, this �me clicking the “Store 2” buton to save it to
Store 2.
3. Finally, select your last sheet and execute the appropriate func�on (for the last/current selec�on, you do not
need to store the resul�ng table).
4. Click the “Sort” buton to show sorted tables.

## Graphing
This func�on is to be used in tandem with the Summarize func�on to display the data visually and can use one or more
sheets (max 12 per summary). For best results, the sheets should be organized such that there are 12 sheets
corresponding to each month per year. To use this func�on:
1. Select your first group of sheets (These should be the sheets that you want reflected in the “Year 1” line for the
graph). Click the “Summarize” buton to generate a summary, then the “Store 1” buton to save this summary in
Store 1.
2. Repeat this process with your second set of up to 12 sheets, clicking the “Summarize” buton and then “Store 2”
to save it to Store 2.
3. Finally, select your last set of up to 12 sheets and click the “Summarize” buton (for the last/current selec�on,
you do not need to store the resul�ng table).
4. Click the “Graph” buton to show a set of 9 graphs reflec�ng the data in each summary.
Notes:
- Each graph can work with between 1 to 12 sheets. However, the graph will not skip months so each point will be
labeled in the order inputed.
- If the “Graph” buton is not working, try clicking “Summarize” (even if you have already generated a summary),
then try the “Graph” buton again.
- The Graph func�on can work as intended for anywhere between 1 and 3 lines per graph (depending on what has
been saved in Store 1 and Store 2)

## Simula�on
This func�on is used in tandem with the “Summarize” func�on to create a Simula�on following an input conven�on and
algorithms predefined by the user. To use this func�on:
1. First select your 5 sheets and create a summary.
2. Then, if exactly 5 sheets have been selected, you can click the “Simulate” buton. This will prompt an input
window which generates default values that you can change.
3. Once your parameters for the simula�on are adjusted, click “Run” to run your simula�on.
