The butons “Store 1” and “Store 2” can be used to save the last table generated for use in the “Sort” and “Graph”
functons. The “Reset Store X” butons each clear their respectve stores.

Summarizing Producton and Transacton Data
This functon can be used for one or more sheets. For best results, let each input sheet be a separate month to show
data over tme. To use this functon, select one or more sheets and then click “Summarize”.

## Sortng
The Sort functon works for showing which sellers appear in a selecton of exactly 3 tme periods. To use this functon:
1. Select your first sheet and click the appropriate buton (8020 Rule Producton, 8020 Rule Transactons, Botom
20 Producton).
2. Once the resultng table shows, click the “Store 1” buton to save the table to Store 1. Next, repeat this process
by selectng your next sheet and the appropriate functon, this tme clicking the “Store 2” buton to save it to
Store 2.
3. Finally, select your last sheet and execute the appropriate functon (for the last/current selecton, you do not
need to store the resultng table).
4. Click the “Sort” buton to show sorted tables.

## Graphing
This functon is to be used in tandem with the Summarize functon to display the data visually and can use one or more
sheets (max 12 per summary). For best results, the sheets should be organized such that there are 12 sheets
corresponding to each month per year. To use this functon:
1. Select your first group of sheets (These should be the sheets that you want reflected in the “Year 1” line for the
graph). Click the “Summarize” buton to generate a summary, then the “Store 1” buton to save this summary in
Store 1.
2. Repeat this process with your second set of up to 12 sheets, clicking the “Summarize” buton and then “Store 2”
to save it to Store 2.
3. Finally, select your last set of up to 12 sheets and click the “Summarize” buton (for the last/current selecton,
you do not need to store the resultng table).
4. Click the “Graph” buton to show a set of 9 graphs reflectng the data in each summary.
Notes:
- Each graph can work with between 1 to 12 sheets. However, the graph will not skip months so each point will be
labeled in the order inputed.
- If the “Graph” buton is not working, try clicking “Summarize” (even if you have already generated a summary),
then try the “Graph” buton again.
- The Graph functon can work as intended for anywhere between 1 and 3 lines per graph (depending on what has
been saved in Store 1 and Store 2)

## Simulaton
This functon is used in tandem with the “Summarize” functon to create a Simulaton following an input conventon and
algorithms predefined by the user. To use this functon:
1. First select your 5 sheets and create a summary.
2. Then, if exactly 5 sheets have been selected, you can click the “Simulate” buton. This will prompt an input
window which generates default values that you can change.
3. Once your parameters for the simulaton are adjusted, click “Run” to run your simulaton.
